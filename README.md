#### Brief Description of your Solution - 
      “StrengthHUB” is a specialized social media platform tailored for fitness enthusiasts. This 
platform will serve as a space for users to share their fitness journey through multimedia 
content, including photos and videos showcasing workouts, healthy meals, and progress 
updates. Additionally, users will be able to interact with each other's posts by liking and 
commenting, fostering a supportive community environment. 
Users will have the ability to share their fitness journey by posting workout routines and
meal plans. And they can also post their status to showcase their daily progress. This 
empowers individuals to inspire and motivate others towards healthier lifestyles. Each user 
will have their own dedicated profile where they can showcase their fitness-related 
activities and achievements, fostering a sense of belonging within the community. 
Additionally, users can connect with fellow fitness enthusiasts by following their profiles, 
creating a network of like-minded individuals.
we will integrate social logins, allowing users to authenticate with their existing accounts 
on popular social media platforms, to streamline the user experience. This ensures a 
seamless onboarding process and enhances user convenience.
We've chosen React.js for the client application frontend, while the backend REST API will 
be implemented using Java Spring Boot. Authentication and authorization will be handled 
through Spring Security and OAuth2 frameworks. We'll adopt the GitHub workflow to 
manage our development process. This approach ensures that code changes are 
systematically tracked, tested, reviewed, and deployed, maintaining a smooth and organized 
workflow throughout the project.
